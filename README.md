### Hi, my name is Dani ðŸ¤™

I'm actually focused on:
- Kubernetes
- Python and golang
- Containers && Conteiners security
- Cloud computng (actually working 100% in AWS services)
- CI/CD with native tools like Tekton

I'm creating my personal webpage using Github pages, to share some posts about my day in life as a Cloud Engineer. Helping the rest is always a pleasure for me.
